# Hi there 👋🏻

This is Cleo, a Software Engineer based in North America. Greetings to my fellow Engineers! 

- 🛠️ I like Engineering, with its core principles of Discipline, Rigor and Practicality. 
- 💻 Getting abstract concepts off the ground is fulfilling and meaningful.
- ✨ I believe in Conpound Learning. Check [💎](https://cleoisme.github.io/resources/) for the resources I have been collecting for my allies.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fullstack Content Management System (CMS) using React and Django, hosted on AWS.
- 🍭 Fun facts: Ask me in person, I have too many.

You can shoot me a message via [Contact me](https://cleoisme.github.io/contact/) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cleo-zhang/).
